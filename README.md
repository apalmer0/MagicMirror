# MagicMirror

Like pretty much everyone else on the planet, this was my first Raspberry Pi project.
It uses a Raspberry Pi, an old monitor, a two-way mirror, and is housed inside a
wooden box I built with my dad.

## Modules

There are currently three modules displayed on the mirror: today's and tomorrow's
forecasts, bucketed into 3-hour segments, my to-do list, and some trivia questions.
I've set up an IFTTT trigger with Google Assistant and a webhook so that I can
add and complete to-do items, or answer trivia questions, via my Google Home smart
speaker.
